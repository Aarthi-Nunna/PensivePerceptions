            Sand trickled down the narrow path<br>
            Time ticked with every passing grain<br>
            One bulb turned empty, the other turned full<br>
            As time ticked by mercilessly<br><br>

            Every grain turned into that of lost time<br>
            Every grain relished the present turning into the past<br>
            But would it stay hidden and beneath the sands of the present?<br>
            And pave way for old and bygone memories to be cherished<br>
            Or would it hide in plain sight above the sands of time?<br><br>

            Fresh and raw from its smiles and hidden scars<br>
            Every granule would bid it's goodbye<br>
            Falling through its chosen path effortlessly<br>
            So would every second of time pass by<br>
            without even a final adieu<br><br>

            The sand was however finite,<br>
            Eventually it would stop falling and running<br>
            Time was limited and it would outrun us all<br>
            And hence would come a point,<br>
            A point where no more sand is left to trickle down<br><br>

            And that is when the hourglass is turned<br>
            And time would start ticking again<br>
            But this time would be different from before<br>
            As we would be living on borrowed time<br><br><br>

            She wandered the streets, a small ingenuous child,<br>
            Streets purporting promises and delicacies of nature offered in mere pence's<br>
            Awestruck by the hues of blue skies and grey cobble muddled together<br>
            A blind naïve eye she had cast on the strings knotted wrong<br><br>

            She inhaled nature in its purest and rawest form,<br>
            Filtering everything that had sinister visiting its vicinity<br>
            She listened to the sound of nature in all its glory, mere background to an unkeen listener<br>
            A deaf ear she had cast to the words of truth and ugly <br><br>

            And she grew a little older with every step she took in the street she called home,<br>
            A little less naïve, a little more blossomed and mature <br>
            A blind eye eventually turned all seeing<br>
            A deaf ear unknowingly turned conscious and hearing<br><br>

            The blues of the sky turned sombre with clouds of grey obscuring the stars<br>
            The grey cobbled street seemed to furl into black tar, not a soul left to dance upon it<br>
            The wrongly knit strings stared blaringly back at her in contrast <br>
            Why had the street once home turned foreign with time? <br><br>

            Nature she had turned to for warmth and comfort seemed null,<br>
            Fragrance of purity lost in the decay of liveliness and the presence of responsibilities <br>
            Sounds of nature discordant with the voices of mankind and internal quarrels <br>
            The innocence of a child’s eye, ignorance a true bliss<br><br><br>

            I sat on an abandoned bench adjacent to a lamp,<br>
            the Sun was asleep and the moon half awake<br>
            The wood felt cold against my bare skin<br>
            Along with the mounds of snow that erased the tracks beneath<br>
            But the light of the lamp was dull and innocent<br>
            Giving out warmth against the cold night sky<br><br>

            I looked at the bulb of the lone lamp post<br>
            Flickering and emitting a dull hue of yellow<br>
            Looking above i met the gaze of countless stars<br>
            Shining bright and stealing the light of the sole crescent<br><br>

            Neither of them seemed to complain....<br>
            About their loneliness or the fear of being overshadowed<br>
            Neither seemed to mind<br>
            The cloudy ether or the misty overcast<br><br>

            Looking down at the white cold blanket<br>
            I brushed away the snow to find some earth<br>
            Finding myself a silhouette, pale and sombre<br>
            Complemented by both the stars and the lamp<br><br>

            Maybe too many cooks didn't have to spoil the broth<br>
            Maybe being alone wasn't a thing to shower pity on or mourn<br>
            Shining alone or as together as one didn't matter<br>
            As both had paved way to the shadows down beneath<br><br><br>

              Illuminating the smallest of space that surrounds you<br>
              Magnificent a sight it would be to see you through a droplet or dew<br>
              Have you ever wondered why you've been given the gift of light?<br>
              Have you ever wondered how you are such a beautiful sight?<br><br>
              
              Your wings seem to capture our every emotion<br>
              And does your light flicker with every thought and notion?<br>
              You've been confined to the walls of this jar<br>
              Regardless you fight and glow bright just like a star<br><br>
              
              Am sorry to have captured you<br>
              But I have a few thoughts I have pondered and want to share with you<br>
              You've managed to shine bright even on the darkest day<br>
              You've had an undying spirit during the grey<br><br>
              
              How has my confinement not rendered you hopeless?<br>
              How have you managed to survive through my mess?<br>
              Dear jar of fireflies, I hope you burn with the same courage and light that will never die<br>
              For your light is my inspiration that I can burn bright during the darkest of times, or atleast try<br><br>
              
              A jar of fireflies<br>
              A mind full of thoughts<br>
              A heart full of emotions<br>
              A soul full of life<br><br><br>
